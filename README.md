# World-Population- Analysis 2023-Web-Scraping-Power-Bi-
ðŸ“ˆ Created a PowerBI interactive dashboard to visualize the World Population 2023 by continents and countries ðŸŒŽ

This project explores world population by continents and countries. The data is scraped directly from the internet from 3 web pages (given below). We then load this data in power BI, clean and transform it in Power Query, then present our findings in an interactive Power BI dashboard.
# SOURCES:
This data was scraped from the following websites:

* POPULATIONS: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country
* CONTINENTS: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/list-of-countries-by-continent
* CAPITAL CITIES: https://geographyfieldwork.com/WorldCapitalCities.htm
